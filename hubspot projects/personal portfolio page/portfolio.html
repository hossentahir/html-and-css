        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Sazzad Hossen, a passionate and determined Software Engineering student at Daffodil International University. I thrive on building creative and efficient solutions through coding, whether it's tackling competitive programming challenges or designing real-world software projects.

            I have strong foundations in Java, C++, C, and database systems, and I’m currently expanding my skills in MERN stack development. I'm also exploring advanced topics like design patterns, robotics systems, and computer networking to become a well-rounded software engineer.
            
            Beyond academics, I love applying my knowledge through projects, competitions, and collaborative research — like participating in the NASA Space Apps Challenge and working on a robot management system review paper with my robotics teacher.
            
            I'm committed to continuous learning, hands-on practice, and sharing what I learn with others. I aim to contribute meaningfully to tech communities and eventually grow into a strong professional in the world of software engineering.
            
            When I'm not coding, you'll find me brainstorming creative ideas, polishing my communication skills for future opportunities, or preparing for certifications and internships to kickstart my career.
            
            Let's connect and build something amazing together!
